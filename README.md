# Pakistan Map
Spatial files for the map of Pakistan. The complete map of Pakistan was not available anywhere on the web. So this is the only source of the complete spatial file.

## What's Special
Pakistan's maps available elsewhere on the web do not include the Indian Occupied Kashmir (IOK). Also, the FATA region is shown separately. In this map, I've added IOK and merged FATA with the KP province.
